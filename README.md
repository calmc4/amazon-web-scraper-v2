Hello! This is an improved version of my previous github project, the previous one used a difficult and annoying method of opening web applications and closing elements which became a whole issue and made further development hard and difficult.

I made this version shortly after it is much more plain and easy.

It works like this
send api request - receieve api data for all jobs - list current jobs

Very simple and does exactly what the website does but requires nothing to be opened and can just be ran in your console and automatically refreshes after 60 seconds.
